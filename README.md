# Responsive Navigation Using Foundation 6
The release of Foundation 6 saw the removal of the equally loved and hated Top Bar. So, to create a horizontal nav that transforms into a typical "hamburger" dropdown menu on small screens needs a little more cutomisation out of the box.

It uses custom media queries to switch between the menus so you don't have to be using Fondation 6 to make use of it.
